                <p>Sometimes, it can also mean that you may not feel like you fit in a world that prizes
                        youthfulness
                        and instant gratification. For instance, the Urban Dictionary defines an old soul as “someone
                        who
                        has a greater appreciation and understanding of things that might be dismissed by others their
                        age.”

                <h3>Top signs that you are an old soul</h3>
                <p>If you know you are an old soul or if you want to confirm that you are one, here are the top ten
                        signs that can help you understand yourself better.</p>
                <h5>You seek out alone time</h5>
                <p>You love spending time by yourself, either reading, pursuing something creative, daydreaming, or
                        simply contemplating. You feel “peopled” out when you meet too many people and feel the need to
                        recharge after a social event. This is usually because you tend to be in touch with the emotions
                        of
                        people around you and you end up feeling overwhelmed.</p>
